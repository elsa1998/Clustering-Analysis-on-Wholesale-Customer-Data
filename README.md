Using K-means clustering method (k=3) to segment each group for different consuming behaviors in 6 product categories.

## Goal
Understand customer spending pattern in different channels, regions, product categories.

## Action
1. Exploratory Data Analysis by correlation and boxplot
2. K-means Clustering: Choose the k = 3 based on SSE curve
3. Normalized and Plot the box plot (based on products and cluster)
4. Data evaluation

## Recommendation
- Bundling grocery, milk, paper & detergent products can lead to an increase in spending.
- Optimizing delivery routes to minimize trips to low-spending client segments can cut costs.
- Ensure product and delivery capacity to meet high demand for fresh and frozen products.
